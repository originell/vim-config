My VIM Adventure
================

This is my VIM adventure. Here I will document what my vim config looks like,
what is different and where my inspirations come from.

Hopefully I will stay strong :-)

vim on OSX Note
===============

On OSX 10.6 you get vim 7.2 but without ruby and python support which, to be
perfectly honest, sucks. The most common and obvious way is to compile vim
yourself. However that did throw me errors with ruby not having a x86_64 
extensions even when I had the x86_64 version installed via `rvm`. Anyways
I then found an article by Chris Moyer about [using MacVIMÂ´s vim 
as _cli_ vim](ihttp://blog.coredumped.org/2010/01/osx-vim-and-python.html).
Saved my day!
